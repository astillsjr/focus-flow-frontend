You are assisting me in implementing the frontend for my FocusFlow app using Vue 3 and Pinia.

**Context:**

* Components: TaskForm.vue, TaskItem.vue, and TaskList.vue


**Task:**
Iterate on a Vue 3 component named `Dashboard.vue` using `<script setup>` syntax.

**Requirements:**
1. Initialize task fetching on mount.
2. Use TaskList.vue for rendering the user's pending and on-going tasks.
3. Add a button for the user's "History" which displays the user's completed tasks.
3. Show a loading state and error message when applicable.
6. Provide a refresh button to manually reload tasks
7. Add functionality for creating tasks.
8. Display the current user's username. 
9. Keep the design minimal â€” focus on functionality, not appearance.

Use best practices with `ref()`, `v-model`, and reactive data (if applicable).
Return only the complete `Dashboard.vue` file.
