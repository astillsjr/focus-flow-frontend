You are assisting me with a Vue 3 + Pinia frontend for my FocusFlow app.

Context:
- The emotion store (`useEmotionStore`) is already implemented with `logBefore()`, `logAfter()`, etc.

Task:
Create a Vue 3 component named `EmotionForm.vue` using <script setup>.
Requirements:
1. Include a select input with v-model for the emotion.
2. Keep the design minimal â€” focus on functionality, not appearance.

Use best practices with `ref()`, `v-model`, and reactive data.
Return only the complete `EmotionForm.vue` file.
